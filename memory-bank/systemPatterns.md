# System Architecture & Design Patterns

## Architectural Style
- **Next.js for SSR & API routes**
- **React for UI components**
- **KDE Plasma scripting for automation**
- **Puppeteer for browser automation**

## Design Patterns Used
- **Factory Pattern** for API calls.
- **Repository Pattern** for data management.
- **Dependency Injection** for service layers.

## TypeScript Strict Mode
- **Enable `strict: true`** in `tsconfig.json` to enforce strict type-checking and improve code quality.

## Caching Strategies
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Use ISR to update static content without rebuilding the entire site.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement SSR for dynamic content that requires frequent updates.
- **Client-Side Caching**: Utilize browser caching and service workers to cache static assets and improve performance.

## Modular Architecture
- **Component-Based Structure**: Organize code into reusable components within the `components/` directory.
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Group related files (e.g., components, hooks, utilities) by feature within the `features/` directory.
- **Layered Architecture**: Separate concerns by organizing code into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
